## MATLAB-Projects
These are the Matlab projects I did at Rutgers 14:440:127 or Intro to Computers for Engineers.

### Project 1 "Geometric Calculator"
This project was focused on the basics of Matlab. The primary purpose is to make calculating geometry easier for the user. It accomplishes this when the user inputs two numbers for measurements and one number correlated to the geometry that needs to be calculated. 

### Project 2 "Sifting Data"
This project has the function to return a subset of data that the user gave it. The function accomplishes that by having the user input an array of data along with its respective categories. When the user wants to return that subset, the function uses loops to index arrays, conditional statements, and statistics to return information about that subset.

### Project 3 "Sinusoidally Varying Color Intensity."
This project was focused on color manipulation and 3-D matrices to create pleasing images. The project utilizes seven inputs given by the user, including the dimensions, frequency, and phase of intensity for red, green, and blue values.  With these seven inputs, I used a simple equation to determine each layer's red, green, and blue values in one 3-D matrix.
